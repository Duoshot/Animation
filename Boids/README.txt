CPSC 587 Assignment 4 Boids
December 8, 2015
TA: Andrew Owens
Done in Visual Studio Community 2015 with GLUT 3.7.6 and GLEW 3.1. Tested on lab computers, but looked way better on mine.


To compile type 'make' in console.
To run, type './boids' in console.

Program reads from two files: sphere_position.txt and numboids.txt.

There is only one collision object, and it is a sphere. Format in file is: x y z r.

Boids are in 3D, the white tip is the head of the boid.

Bonus not implemented.

Helped Mike Wang so some code might look similar. All other code from tutorials and https://sites.google.com/site/drunkdevsltd/tutorials/draw-a-sphere-using-opengl-3-3
